## 📌 About
**The Python Voyage** is my personal journey of mastering Python — from fundamentals to advanced concepts.  
This repository captures my learning process using [W3Schools Python Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/python/) while tracking **daily consistency** through GitHub commits 📊.  

It serves as:  
- 🚀 A structured progress tracker  
- 📝 A repository of practice code & notes  
- 🔥 A streak log to maintain daily consistency  
- 🎯 A portfolio to showcase growth  

---

## 🎯 Goals
- 🐍 Build a solid foundation in Python  
- 📅 Maintain daily coding practice  
- 🛠 Apply concepts through small projects
